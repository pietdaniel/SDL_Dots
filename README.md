Hi, Welcome to a very simple SDL program.

It has a timer object, a dot object, some
global variables, and the Main.cpp file.

There is an animation loop, collision
detection, and some basic physics.

In the future I would like to add 
functionality for simulated
movement based on 
subroutines
in the
class
dot
.


Also,I would like to seperate some of
the functions in main into a graphics
class and a engine class.
