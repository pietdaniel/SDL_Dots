Hi, Welcome to a very simple SDL program.<br>

It has a timer object, a dot object, some<br>
global variables, and the Main.cpp file.<br>

There is an animation loop, collision<br>
detection, and some basic physics.<br>

In the future I would like to add <br>
functionality for simulated<br>
movement based on <br>
subroutines<br>
in the<br>
class<br>
dot<br>
.<br>


Also,I would like to seperate some of<br>
the functions in main into a graphics<br>
class and a engine class. <br>
